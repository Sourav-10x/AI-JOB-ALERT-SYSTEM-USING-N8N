# ðŸ’¼ AI Job Alert System | n8n + OpenAI + Gmail

This workflow automates job hunting using the power of AI and no-code tools. Built with *n8n, it fetches the latest listings from job board RSS feeds, summarizes them using **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**, and emails you neatly formatted job alerts â€” all on autopilot. Whether you're looking for remote internships or tech roles, this bot has your back every day.

At the core of the system is a **Schedule Trigger**, which runs the workflow at set intervals (e.g. daily). It pulls fresh jobs via an **RSS node**, feeds the content to **OpenAI** for clean bullet-point summaries, and then sends the final result straight to your inbox through **Gmail integration**.

The setup is lightweight, flexible, and 100% customizable â€” you can tweak the RSS source, change the OpenAI prompt, or even add filters for keywords like "Python", "Remote", or "Intern". Itâ€™s a perfect blend of automation and intelligence â€” designed to save your time and boost your opportunities.

If you're a student, a job seeker, or just love building smart tools, this AI-powered alert system is a simple but powerful project worth showcasing.
